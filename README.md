## Data Warehousing Portfolio Project
This repository showcases a complete data warehousing and analytics solution, built as a portfolio project.
It covers the full lifecycle from designing and building a data warehouse to extracting meaningful, actionable insights. The project follows industry best practices in data engineering, data modeling, ETL processes, and analytics, making it a strong demonstration of real-world skills.

### Data Archietecture 
This project implements the Medallion Architecture framework, structured into three layers:
1. Bronze Layer: Captures raw, unprocessed data directly from source systems. In this project, data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.
2. Silver Layer: Focuses on data refinement, including cleansing, standardization, and normalization, to ensure high-quality, analysis-ready data.
3. Gold Layer: Contains business-ready, curated data, modeled into a star schema to support reporting, analytics, and actionable insights.
