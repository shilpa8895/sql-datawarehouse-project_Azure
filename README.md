## Data Warehousing Portfolio Project
This repository showcases a complete data warehousing and analytics solution, built as a portfolio project.
It covers the full lifecycle from designing and building a data warehouse to extracting meaningful, actionable insights. The project follows industry best practices in data engineering, data modeling, ETL processes, and analytics, making it a strong demonstration of real-world skills.

### Data Archietecture 
This project implements the Medallion Architecture framework, structured into three layers:
1. Bronze Layer: Captures raw, unprocessed data directly from source systems. In this project, data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.
2. Silver Layer: Focuses on data refinement, including cleansing, standardization, and normalization, to ensure high-quality, analysis-ready data.
3. Gold Layer: Contains business-ready, curated data, modeled into a star schema to support reporting, analytics, and actionable insights.

### Project Overview
1. **`Data Architecture:`** Built a modern data warehouse based on the Medallion Architecture, leveraging Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers for structured data flow.
2. **`ETL Development:`** Designed and implemented ETL pipelines to ingest, transform, and load data from source files into the warehouse.
3. **`Data Modeling:`** Created optimized fact and dimension tables to enable efficient analytical querying and reporting.
4. **`Analytics & Reporting:`** Developed SQL queries and dashboards to translate raw data into meaningful, actionable business insights.

### Project Setup
1. Install SQL Server on MacBook: Since SQL Server does not run natively on macOS,set it up using Docker:
Step 1: Install Docker Desktop for Mac.
Step 2: Pull the SQL Server Docker image:
```
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
```
Step 3: Run the SQL Server container:
```
docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=YourStrongPassword!' \
-p 1433:1433 --name sql_server_container -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
```
Replace YourStrongPassword! with a strong password (must meet SQL Server password requirements).

Step 4: Connect to SQL Server using a SQL client like: Azure Data Studio (recommended for Mac)
